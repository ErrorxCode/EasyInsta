## FAQ

#### [Q.1] Can we use this library to make bots ?

Answer. Yes. But Instagram don't allow to make bots with their officail graph APIs. Altho This is not the officail api, but you should still follow the usage limits to prevent detection.

#### [Q.2] Can we download stories or posts using this API ?

Answer. No, Use [Instagram basic display API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/) for that.

#### [Q.3] Does use of this library requires any tokens or other keys ?

Answer. No. You only need to have username and password of the account.
